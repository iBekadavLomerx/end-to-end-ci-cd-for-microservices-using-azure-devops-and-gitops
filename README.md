## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the "End-to-End CI/CD for Microservices using Azure DevOps & GitOps" project. This guide will help you download and run the application without any technical skills. Whether you are new to CI/CD or just looking for an easy way to manage your applications, you are in the right place.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project provides a complete solution to create Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for applications built with Python, .NET, and Java. It uses Redis for quick data access and MySQL for data storage. You can manage deployments easily using Azure DevOps and GitOps workflows.

### 🛠 Tools and Technologies

Here are the main tools we use in this project:
- Azure DevOps
- GitOps
- Argo CD
- AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)
- Docker
- Programming Languages: Python, .NET, Java
- Redis
- MySQL

This combination of tools ensures efficient software development and deployment.

## 🌐 How It Works

The application automates the deployment of microservices. When you push changes to the code, it triggers the CI/CD pipeline. This pipeline helps to build, test, and deploy the application without manual intervention. 

### Key Features

- **Automated Builds:** The application builds itself every time you make changes.
- **Reliable Deployments:** You can trust the application will work as expected.
- **Multi-Service Management:** Easily manage multiple microservices with one solution.

## 📖 Project Walk-through

1. **Migrated Multi-Microservice Repository:** We moved a multi-microservice repository from GitHub to Azure Repos for better version control.
